GazeLib is a programming library which making real-time low-cost gaze tracking becomes possible. The library provide functions performing remote gaze tracking under ambient lighting condition using a single, low cost, off-the-shelf web-cam. Developers can easily build gaze tracking technologies implemented applications in only few lines of code.

GazeLib project focuses on promoting gaze tracking technology to consumer-grade human computer interfaces by reducing the price, emphasizing ease-of-use, increasing the extendability, and enhancing the flexibility and mobility.
